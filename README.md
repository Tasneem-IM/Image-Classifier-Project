# Image-Classifier-Project
In this Udacity project, I developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify flower images from the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset. I used transfer learning with MobileNet and trained the model on GPU-enabled Udacity Workspaces. I also created a command-line application that predicts the flower type from an input image.
