# 🌸 Flower Image Classifier 🌸

This project is part of **AI Programming with Python and TensorFlow Nanodegree**. It uses **transfer learning** with a pre-trained **MobileNet** model to classify images of flowers from the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.

---

## ✨ Features
- Loads and preprocesses the **Oxford Flowers 102** dataset.
- Uses **transfer learning** with MobileNet for image classification.
- Trains and validates the model with **data augmentation** and **normalization**.
- Saves and loads the trained Keras model (`.h5` file).
- Includes a **command-line application** (`predict.py`) to predict flower names from input images.
- Supports **top-K predictions** and **category name mapping** via JSON files.
